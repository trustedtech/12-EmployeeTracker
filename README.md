# 12-EmployeeTracker
A solution for managing company structures and employee details for an organization.

At first, I get really stuck because I could not figure-out how to run sequential database queries and how to pass the query data up to the caller function.  It took much research and trial and error to iron all of this out.  It also helped a great deal to have the final solution handy, however I was able to come upon the same technique used in the final solution by honest means through my research.  

Ultimately, this assignment helped me solidify the use of Promises in Javascript as well as the utility of the mysql and inquirer modules.  This was a very long and tedious process, but I'm glad I worked through it and was able to produce the application with all its required functionalities.
